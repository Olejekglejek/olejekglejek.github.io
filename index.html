          <p>A personal project whose goal was to understand the process entitlement of the manufacturing process. Taught myself VBA and R programming in less than a month. Used these programming languages to build a manufacturing model that will help to predict the outcomes based on the design (process and product) and processing the data through a statistical method for quality improvement with a Plexus approach.</p>
          <p>Then implemented a Python script to automate the process of collecting the data from the database and importing it in the spreadsheets. This model helps to define the process yield of each test station and the whole process.</p>
          <p>Also had a basic induction in network infrastructure: Design, plan, and implementation of the network (data, voice); Configure and deploy an array of network devices (switches, routers, wireless access points, firewall, etc.) and systems (Cisco, PABX).</p>

          <p>Team project -Smart wheelchair for people with vision and motion disabilities.</p>
          <p>Build a surveillance system using the camera module for Raspberry pi 4 to help people with vision disabilities. As hardware was used Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano with the camera module or another USB webcam and a Doppler radar from National Instruments.
            The logic was fully implemented on Python with its deep neural networks (dnn) module from the OpenCV library. The system is able to detect nearby objects with help of radar or Single Shot Detectors (SSD) algorithm and recognize them with Mobile Nets neural network. The output is an audio message through the headset.</p>

          <p>Implemented automation scripts on operating systems and software updates using Python and bash programming.
            Installed and configured two host servers with VMware ESXi virtualization O/S. Installed Server 2012r2 on a server. Created an iSCSI target on the 2012r2 server. Connected the iSCSI to the ESXi host servers as storage, installed VCSA, and used vCenter Service Appliance (VCSA) to manage the two VMware ESXi hosts. Also installed virtual machines using VCSA. Set up a standalone network.</p>
